Corresponding medium post can be found here . About the Project \u00b6 Although that are already many methods available for keyword generation (e.g., Rake , YAKE! , TF-IDF, etc.) I wanted to create a very basic, but powerful method for extracting keywords and keyphrases. This is where KeyBERT comes in! Which uses BERT-embeddings and simple cosine similarity to find the sub-phrases in a document that are the most similar to the document itself. First, document embeddings are extracted with BERT to get a document-level representation. Then, word embeddings are extracted for N-gram words/phrases. Finally, we use cosine similarity to find the words/phrases that are the most similar to the document. The most similar words could then be identified as the words that best describe the entire document. KeyBERT is by no means unique and is created as a quick and easy method for creating keywords and keyphrases. Although there are many great papers and solutions out there that use BERT-embeddings (e.g., 1 , 2 , 3 , ), I could not find a BERT-based solution that did not have to be trained from scratch and could be used for beginners ( correct me if I'm wrong! ). Thus, the goal was a pip install keybert and at most 3 lines of code in usage. NOTE : If you use MMR to select the candidates instead of simple cosine similarity, this repo is essentially a simplified implementation of EmbedRank with BERT-embeddings. Installation \u00b6 PyTorch 1.2.0 or higher is recommended. If the install below gives an error, please install pytorch first here . Installation can be done using pypi : pip install keybert Usage \u00b6 The most minimal example can be seen below for the extraction of keywords: from keybert import KeyBERT doc = \"\"\" Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.[1] It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.[2] In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.
