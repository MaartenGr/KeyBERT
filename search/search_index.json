This is where KeyBERT comes in! Which uses BERT-embeddings and simple cosine similarity to find the sub-phrases in a document that are the most similar to the document itself.</p> <p>First, document embeddings are extracted with BERT to get a document-level representation. Then, word embeddings are extracted for N-gram words/phrases. Finally, we use cosine similarity to find the words/phrases that are the most similar to the document. The most similar words could then be identified as the words that best describe the entire document.</p> <p>KeyBERT is by no means unique and is created as a quick and easy method for creating keywords and keyphrases. Although there are many great papers and solutions out there that use BERT-embeddings (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ), I could not find a BERT-based solution that did not have to be trained from scratch and could be used for beginners (correct me if I'm wrong!).

Then, word embeddings are extracted\n    for N-gram words/phrases. Finally, we use cosine similarity to find the\n    words/phrases that are the most similar to the document.\n\n    The most similar words could then be identified as the words that\n    best describe the entire document.\n\n    &lt;div class=\"excalidraw\"&gt;\n    --8&lt;-- \"docs/images/pipeline.svg\"\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, model=\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\", llm: BaseLLM = None):\n\"\"\"KeyBERT initialization\n\n        Arguments:\n            model: Use a custom embedding model.\n                   The following backends are currently supported:\n                      * SentenceTransformers\n                      * \ud83e\udd17 Transformers\n                      * Flair\n                      * Spacy\n                      * Gensim\n                      * USE (TF-Hub)\n                    You can also pass in a string that points to one of the following\n                    sentence-transformers models:\n                      * https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html\n        \"\"\"\n        self.model = select_backend(model)\n\n        if isinstance(llm, BaseLLM):\n            self.llm = KeyLLM(llm)\n        else:\n            self.llm = llm\n\n    def extract_keywords(\n        self,\n        docs: Union[str, List[str]],\n        candidates: List[str] = None,\n        keyphrase_ngram_range: Tuple[int, int] = (1, 1),\n        stop_words: Union[str, List[str]] = \"english\",\n        top_n: int = 5,\n        min_df: int = 1,\n        use_maxsum: bool = False,\n        use_mmr: bool = False,\n        diversity: float = 0.5,\n        nr_candidates: int = 20,\n        vectorizer: CountVectorizer = None,\n        highlight: bool = False,\n        seed_keywords: Union[List[str], List[List[str]]] = None,\n        doc_embeddings: np.array = None,\n        word_embeddings: np.array = None,\n        threshold: float = None\n    ) -&gt;

When applying KeyBERT it automatically extracts the most related keywords to a specific document. However, there are times when stakeholders and users are looking for specific types of keywords. For example, when publishing an article on your website through contentful, you typically already know the global keywords related to the article. However, there might be a specific topic in the article that you would like to be extracted through the keywords. To achieve this, we simply give KeyBERT a set of related seeded keywords (it can also be a single one!) and search for keywords that are similar to both the document and the seeded keywords.</p> Input DocumentTokenize WordsEmbed TokensExtract EmbeddingsAverage seed keyword and document embeddingsCalculateCosine SimilarityMost microbats use echolocationto navigate and find food.Most microbats...sonarmostmicrobatsuse echolocationtonavigate andfindfood0.110.550.320.28................0.720.960.490.34mostfoodMost microbats...mostfood.......08.73We use the CountVectorizer from Scikit-Learn to tokenize our document into candidate kewords/keyphrases.We embed the seeded keywords (e.g., the word \u201csonar\u201d) and calculate a weighted average with the document embedding (1:3).
